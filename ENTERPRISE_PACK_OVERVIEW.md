# PAXECT Enterprise Pack Overview â€” AEAD Hybrid Plugin

Welcome!  
This document outlines the **Enterprise Pack vision** for the **PAXECT AEAD Hybrid Plugin**.  
It explains what is open source today, and what enterprise-level features may be introduced in the future.

---

## Scope

The **open-source foundation** remains free and Apache-2.0 licensed:

- PAXECT-Core (deterministic runtime)  
- AEAD-Hybrid plugin (secure authenticated encryption)  
- Polyglot plugin (cross-language data flow)  
- SelfTune plugin (adaptive control logic)  
- Link plugin (relay + policy layer)  
- Demo suite (01â€“10) and CI test matrix  

The **Enterprise Pack** adds optional capabilities for organizations that require  
advanced security, compliance, or production-grade observability.

---

## Vision

The Enterprise Pack is designed to **extend** the AEAD Hybrid Plugin â€” not replace it.  
It focuses on:

- **Hardware-level encryption** (HSM / TPM / Vault / KMS integration)  
- **Advanced key lifecycle management**  
- **Encrypted CI/CD pipelines** with signature verification  
- **Structured audit and traceability reports (JSONL / JUnit)**  
- **Monitoring connectors** (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Kafka)  
- **Deployment tooling** (Docker, systemd, Helm)  
- **Compliance mappings** (ISO 27001 Â· IEC 62443 Â· NIST SP 800-57)  
- Optional **enterprise support SLAs**

---

## Community & Ownership

- The AEAD Hybrid Plugin remains fully **open source** under Apache-2.0.  
- The Enterprise Pack extensions are **proprietary** to the project Owner.  
- Future **partners or maintainers** may collaborate on enterprise integrations.  
- There is **no vendor lock-in** â€” the plugin can always run independently.

---

## Participation

At this stage:
- We **do not sell or distribute** enterprise extensions yet.  
- We **welcome volunteers and partners** to help test or design enterprise features.  
- Interested organizations can join through:

## Key Principle

> **Open Core. Verified Extensions. Zero Telemetry by Default.**

The mission is to deliver a trustworthy encryption framework â€” deterministic, auditable, and verifiable â€”  
for both community developers and enterprise environments.
